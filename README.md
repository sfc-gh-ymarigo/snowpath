This repository contains all the source code of the Snowpath Streamlit App.

Snowpath™ native Streamlit application allows users to easily and visually perform and deep dive into Path Analysis, Attribution Analysis, Association Analysis and event-based Prediction Modeling by simply specifying a few parameters in drop-down menus. Leveraging advanced techniques, Snowpath™ intuitively and visually helps identify touchpoints influencing customer (or machine) behaviours, targets them to create segments, performs cross-population behavioural comparisons, computes rule-based and ML-driven attribution models to understand the contribution of each event preceding a specific outcome, conducts association analysis to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between events and eventually predict outcomes based on event sequences. Snowpath™ is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise, making it a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making. Snowpath™ also leverages the interpretive and generative power of LLMs thanks to Snowflake AISQL to explain journeys, attribution models,  association rules and derive insights (summarize and analyze results, describe behaviors and even suggest actions !)
Identifying, visualizing and explaining paths can itself be actionable and often uncovers an area of interest for additional analysis. First, the picture revealed by path analysis can be further enriched with attribution and association analysis. Attribution helps quantify the contribution of individual touchpoint to a defined outcome, while association analysis uncovers relationships between events that frequently occur together. Together, these techniques provide a holistic understanding of event sequences, enabling data-driven decision-making and uncovering new opportunities for optimization. Second, path insights can be used directly to predict outcomes or to derive behavioral features (such as the frequency of specific patterns). These features can then be integrated into existing predictive models, enhancing their accuracy and enabling deeper behavioral segmentation.
